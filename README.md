# Analyzing Equal Pay by Group AE5
## By: Tejveer, Yash, and Eugene

The shiny app operating files, as well as the databases and other resources, are located within this GitHub repo. Over the past week, our group has worked on conducting a professional breakdown of the equal pay issue. To operate the finished app, please head on over to the published version on the Shiny website: 
    https://trrai.shinyapps.io/finalproject/. Here you will be able to interactive with the visuals using the 
    wage gap range slider, or by selecting specific occupations. In addition, you can interact with the line 
    graph by selecting a specific country to display.
